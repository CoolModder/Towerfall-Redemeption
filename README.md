## Todo:

### Pets
New creatures from the Dark World have arrived! Use the new net arrows to capture them. Trap and free them to gain their powerful boosts!
### Monsters
It seems some of the pet's parents came with them. These new beasts will destroy all who oppose them, so be wary.
### Gui Overhaul
Sick of the bland gems on the screen?
### Supers
Charge up supers, then unleash them to destroy any who oppose you.
