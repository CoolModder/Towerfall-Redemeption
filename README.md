## Todo:
### Custom Arrows
Enjoy many custom arrows, all ready to shake up the competition!
### Pets
New creatures from the Dark World have arrived! Use the new net arrows to capture them. Trap and free them to gain their powerful boosts!
### Monsters
It seems some of the pet's parents came with them. These new beasts will destroy all who oppose them, so be wary.
## In Progress:
### TowerBall
Getting those last bugs out!
### Gui Overhaul
Sick of the bland gems on the screen?
### Supers
Charge up supers, then unleash them to destroy any who oppose you.
### Fixing Archer Loader (https://github.com/RedDude/ArcherLoader/releases/tag/v1.1.0) for custom gamemodes
Very Important, and is much needed.
