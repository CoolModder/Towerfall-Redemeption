Custom logos go in Content/Mod/CustomLogos
To use custom logos, you have to go into Saves/Com.CoolModder.MenuVariantsMod and edit the MenuVariant value due to FortRise's limitations. Sorry.
Currently, you can customize everything accept the core of the Tower and Letters.
You can also move Bg's position
Custom Towers have not been tested
This mod may be updated later, as I could add more customization options.
